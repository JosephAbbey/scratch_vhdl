# Modelsim-Lite Installation

1. Go to [
Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition Design Software Version \<ver\> for Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/660907/intel-quartus-prime-lite-edition-design-software-version-20-1-1-for-windows.html)
2. Select the software version to download, here select version `20.1.1` for now.
3. Select the "Individual Files" tab.
4. Click on `ModelSimSetup-20.1.1.720-windows.exe`, which will ask you to agree to a Legal disclaimer and then start your download.

You may try to download the more recent version of the simulator which has been upgraded to QuestaSim, however you will need to request a free licence. The instructions to follow are detailed at [VHDL Whiz](https://vhdlwhiz.com/free-vhdl-simulator-alternatives/), and involve extra steps such as filling out a form for a licence request with your network card's MAC address and installing a license file. I'm sure it will be fine ;-). For the impatient, stick to ModelSim ver 20.1.1, it will do well enough.
