# "Crypto"

_Demonstration cipher generator (with shortcomings)_.

A really basic demonstration of encrypting a message so that it cannot easily be intercepted by an eavesdropper, but can be decrypted on receipt by the intended recipient. The following picture illustrates the top level plan for a basic [stream cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher). Note that the 'time increment' signal `incr` used to slow operation down to visible speeds has been omitted for brevity.

The red blocks indicate where sensitive data (the original message) is readable (unencrypted) and hence susceptible to being read. The green block shows where the message is 'safe' from eavesdroppers such that they should not be able to read it. The 'key enable' button is also a risk as when disabled, the message is readable by eavesdroppers. Once the message is encrypted it can be safely transmitted as it is protected. Well, to some extent as it depends on the cryptographic strength of the algorithm and the amount of investment an eavesdropper is prepared to invest to decrypt any messages.

**You will also note that we have not provided any means of entering a _key_.** Typically a cryptographic algorithm is published and its inner workings widely understood. This provides the ability to review the algorithm and faults to be found. It also provides transparency for others users and hence trust that it works. A key is then required to change the sequence of `0`s and `1`s used as the generated key material. The key would need to be correctly entered at both ends of the communication link. The key has been omitted to keep the demonstration simple.

## Parts

In order to encrypt a message (sensitive data) into a cipher, key material needs to be generated. The key material is a sequence of `0`s and `1`s that is XOR'ed with the message, also a sequence of `0`s and `1`s. The unencrypted message is often referred to as _plain text_ and the encrypted message as _cipher text_. An 2 input XOR gate is used here because it is effectively a conditional inverter, i.e. the output is the inverse of one of the inputs when the second input is high. When the second input is low, no inversion occurs. Now the key material can be used to choose if inversion occurs or not, scrambling the message so it cannot be read.

![Encryption XOR](images/scratch_blocks/crypto_cipher_xor.png)

All that we need to do to unencrypt the cipher text is regenerate the key material at the receiving end and keep the key material synchronised with the cipher text. _Easy!?_

![Decryption XOR](images/scratch_blocks/crypto_plain_xor.png)

Also for demonstration purposes, we'll provide the means to turn encryption on and off so that it is obvious what the effect of the key material is when the encryption is turned on. The LEDs will be used to display the sequence of `0`s an `1`s later.

![Encryption Enable](images/scratch_blocks/crypto_cipher_enable.png)

For our key material generator, we'll take some cryptographic short cuts for reasons of accessibility. We'll use a [pseudo random number generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator) for which we already have two implementations from the [linear feedback shift register](lfsr.md) (LFSR). Here we've chosen the internal feedback implementation for no particular reason. Having only 4-bits of _entropy_ (less given we can only use 15 of the maximum 2<sup>4</sup> values) this is not cryptographically secure by any means, but as you've gathered by now, we only have 4 bits to play with! Having generated the pseudo random sequence of 4-bit values, we then take only the bottom bit of each value in the sequence for the key material, because we only need one bit to feed the XOR gate.

An example of a (bad) key implementation here might be to reset the LFSR to a different starting value in each LFRS instance. Then the generated key material sequence would start in a different place for each choice of key. This is bad for two reasons:

1. There are only 15 possible keys in this implementation.
2. The sequence is just rotated, not completely shuffled, for each different key.

There is no sensible means of specifying a key with only 4 buttons in our design, hance no means of changing the key has been included.

![Message Transmission Key Generation](images/scratch_blocks/crypto_src_key_gen.png)

This video demonstates a pseudo-random sequence generated by [one of the demonstrations](lfsr.md).

The same key material generator is used on receipt, now running out of phase with the original, but hopefully in phase with the encrypted message. Rather than re-use the original sequence for encryption, this regeneration is realistic of a real world implementation since one must not transmit the key material itself as it could then be used by an eavesdropper to decrypt the cipher text. That would provide no privacy at all!

![Message Reception Key Generation](images/scratch_blocks/crypto_dest_key_gen.png)

Then in order to demonstrate what is going on we provide status via four LEDs.

| LED | Purpose                         |
|-----|---------------------------------|
|  3  | Original message (plain text)   |
|  2  | Encryption enabled              |
|  1  | Encrypted message (cipher text) |
|  0  | Decrypted message (plain text)  |

| Button | Purpose           |
|--------|-------------------|
|    3   | Message creation  |
|    2   | Encryption enable |
|    1   | Unused            |
|    0   | Unused            |

Using `button(3)` to generate a message, or sequence of `0`s and `1`s, displayed via `led(3)`, one time increment later the cipher text is created and displayed on `led(1)`, and then one more time increment and the decrypted message is displayed on `led(0)`. `button(2)` is used to enable encryption and its current status is displayed in `led(2)`.

## Scratch VHDL Code Structure

For this example we have broken out of the "single clocked `process` is sufficient" coding style in order to separate out the different functionality into describe-able sections. Not least because we want the illusion of two separate ends of the message transmission link in spite of having both co-located on a single FPGA board. The code would work perfectly fine if grouped into a single process. Once designs start to grow, the single `process` style is less helpful. The Scratch VHDL editor is able to cope with multiple `process`es.

## Application Controls

The controls have been annotated in the picture below. Creating a message with the push button is more interactive than a toggle button. The 'encryption enable' is best achieved with a toggle button so it can be left in one position. As all buttons are wired up in pairs, you can choose to operate the application differently.

## Video Demonstration

The video below shows the operation of the "Crypto" application. Firstly without encryption, and then with.

Without encryption you see `led(3)` (original message) propagates to `led(1)` and then `led(0)` which each time increment. When toggle `button(2)` is changed, you see `led(1)` (encrypted message) no longer mirrors `led(3)` (original message). `led(0)` (decrypted message) shows the successful decryption of `led(1)`. Note that `led(1)`(encrypted message) changes even when the original message does not, and decryption still returns the original message faithfully.

## Limits of this "Crypto" application

As already mentioned, this demonstration is limited by comparison with a real cryptographic product. Here are some of the limits:

1. Both ends of the communication line are co-located on the same FPGA board. Typically the encrypted message would be transmitted between locations, e.g. over the air.
2. There is no provision to enter a _[key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography))_ and change the way the sequence of `0`s and `1`s is generated for the key material feeding the XOR gates.
3. The key material generator needs to have much more '[entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28computing%29)' (or for the really keen see this [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory))), meaning a bigger pool of randomness to extract the key sequence from.
4. Synchronisation is provided by a net across the transmission line where the message is encrypted. This is unrealistic, so what alternatives might be used? E.g. start of message, but that's not helpful in a continuous data stream. Or derivation of the key material from a source known at both ends, e.g. the cipher text? That is known as a [self-synchronizing stream cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher#Self-synchronizing_stream_ciphers).
5. The ability to turn off encryption represents a risk where user error is concerned.
6. There is no attempt to maintain [separation of encrypted and unencrypted paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red/black_concept) to prevent any shorts causing compromise.

## Elaboration with Vivado

The elaborated design below has been coloured to show key aspects of the realised design.

![Elaboration with Vivado](images/vivado/crypto.png)

| Colour                                   | Significance      |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| <span style="color:green">Green</span>   | Encryption path   |
| <span style="color:red">Red</span>       | Decryption path   |
| <span style="color:orange">Orange</span> | Encryption enable |

The two key generators are `key_src_reg` and `key_dest_reg` since Vivado adds `_reg` to all registers. XOR gates are also used by the two LFSRs.
