# Binary Counter

The code uses an integer, a conversion function then creates the 4-bit binary value to be displayed. The integer's value needs to be constrained to the range 0..15 and the counter roll-over managed. What happens if the count range is unconstrained, even if the roll-over value is managed correctly? Two buttons operate `start` and `stop`.

No its not rocket science, some people may not be familiar. It could prove a useful revision for some of the later demonstrations.
