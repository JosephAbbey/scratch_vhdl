# Vivado IP

This directory is initially empty.

A TCL script is used to generate a piece of "Vivado IP" from from the IP Catalogue. The "Clock Wizard" is required to generate a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) component with its simulation model. The results of generation will each have their own IP subdirectory.
